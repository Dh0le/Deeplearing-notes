The note for deep learning course and reading

This note is mainly for the knowledge from Coursera's deep learning course taught by Andrew Ng.

The note starts from Lesson2 Week 2 because the content before that are too basic and might not require such notes.

I will try to make the notes after I go through the entire course content.

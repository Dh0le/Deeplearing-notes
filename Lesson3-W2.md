## Carrying out error analysis

Should you try to make a cat classifier do better on dogs?

Error analysis:

-  Get ~100 mislabeled dev set examples
-  Count up how many are dogs and figure out how much can we actually improve on it.

Evaluate multiple ideas in parallel:

- Fix pictures of dogs being recognized as cats
- Fix great cats (lion, panthers,etc..)being misrecognized.
- Improve performance on blurry images.

Using a spreadsheet to tell the distribution of such mislabeled images.

So we can easily set up developing priority.
